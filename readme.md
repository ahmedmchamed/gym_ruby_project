# CodeClan Solo Ruby Project

![homepage_screenshot](/design/homepage_screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Homepage Screenshot")

## Brief

A web app for practicing some Ruby. This app has a page dedicated to classes, where staff can add additional classes or modify details of existing ones, at which point the page updates to reflect the changes. Members can see upcoming classes and book slots, on top of modifying their own personal details.

Staff are also assigned roles, and if a member books a class that does not have a member of staff already allocated to it, the app will arrange for a staff member who is free to take charge of the class.

## Starting the app

To start the app, run `ruby controller.rb`, and navigate to `http://localhost:4567/superhappyfungym`
